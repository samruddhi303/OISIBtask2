            <div class = "content">Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist, and a former chairman of Tata Sons.
                 He was also chairman of Tata Group, from 1990 to 2012, and again, as interim chairman, from October 2016 through February 2017, 
                 and continues to head its charitable trusts.
                  He is the recipient of two of the highest civilian awards of India, the Padma Vibhushan (2008) and Padma Bhushan (2000). He is well known for his business ethics and philanthropy.
                  Ratan Tata was born to one of India's most prosperous industrialist families in Mumbai in 1937.<br/>
                   His grandfather Jamsedji Tata was the founder of Tata Group, who pioneered industrialisation in India after independence. 
                   Tata went to Cornell University in the US to study architecture and structural engineering and later pursued a management course from Harvard University.
                    Despite being the future chairman of Tata Group, he started his career at the root level working alongside blue-collar employees in Tata Steel Division.
                     In 1971, Tata was appointed the Director-in-Charge of the National Radio and Electronics Company Limited (NELCO), which was in a dire need for a revival and turned it around.</div>
